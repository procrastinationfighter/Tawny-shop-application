# Tawny-shop-application
Application responsable for managing an internet shop. It provides a RESTful API with GET, POST and DELETE methods. Currently working features:
* Processing incomming requests (create transaction, get transaction, delete transaction, delete old transactions, get api information, get module information)
* Connection to a Postgres database.
* Handling exceptions occuring as a result of wrong request

Project created with a purpose of learning through practice. Most of used technologies (except Java) were unknown to me prior to writing it.
Code reviewed and supervised by [@idekpas](https://github.com/idekpas).

Currently on hiatus.
